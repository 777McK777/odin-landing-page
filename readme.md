This is my first full from scratch website including the use of CSS.
I've really been trying my best to stay active and focus on learning and
bettering myself daily. But since having my little one it's gotten more
difficult to force myself to do this. I keep craving little bursts of
dopamine from sitting alone and escpaing from reality. But then I just end up
feeling bad for not getting any better at life. I'm constantly surrounded by
these experts in every field I'm a part of. Nervousness and age are both
playing a part in my little spiraling. I feel like I'm never good enough but
the same time never motivated enough, or smart enough to learn and most
importantly RETAIN all of the things I need to know to keep up with everyone
else. I'm smart I know that for a fact. But damn if it doesn't feel like I
actually need to be smarter every single day. This anxiety constantly pushes
me to feel as if I'm inadequate at everything I do. I second guess myself
alot and then end up using others as a crutch for validation which in turn
makes me seem week, unsure, and not someone to be confidently relied upon.
That, then doesn't exactly inspire self-confidence either. Constantly being
worried that your peers, and bosses are always thinking you're not actually
as good as they thought you were. Wife and family too.

But you are as good as they KNOW you are. It's all in my head. I know that,
the thing is if I don't keep it there and continue to let it burst forth, I
probably will self-fulfill the prophecy I'm so anxiously trying to avoid.
